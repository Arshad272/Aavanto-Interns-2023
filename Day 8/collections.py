# Collection Data types
# Python Collections (Arrays)
# There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

# List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate elements.

# Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate elements.

# Set is a collection which is unordered, and unindexed. No duplicate elements.

# Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate keys.

# d = {1.5 : 'hello', 1.9 : 'hii'}
# print(d[1.9])


# if you directly assign multiple elements to a variable means, then all those elements will be stored in a tuple
a = 10, 20, 30
# print(a)
# print(type(a)) 

z = {}
# print(type(z))
